### About
I had problem with my old notebook which is Alienware m17x R4 (üëΩ) that there was no way to update BIOS with dead battery, I tried plenty ways to bypass this but nothing worked at the end. So, I made this little patcher which will allow you to update BIOS even with dead battery but please, think twice before using it.

### How to use
Basically, you run bios update .exe and wait till it says that your battery should be charger for 10% or more percent and then inject compiled dll in to InsydeFlash.exe. (For example: you can use ProcessHacker to inject it). Then press OK and viola. Its works.
